                    <p>It all started in 2011 when I worked as an alarm maintenance technician. I had a lot of free time
                        and
                        I thought what to do with it. One of my friends tried his hand at website development and after
                        telling
                        me alot about it, I was very interested. I found courses online and started learning. I tried it
                        and I liked it)
                        The technology stack was HTML, CSS, PHP. The first site was for my parents and was a catalog of
                        their favorite recipes. The second one was ordered by my friend for their biker club. It was a
                        simple site
                        with basic information about the club and the events organized by the club, which was filled by
                        me. For
                        the full implementation of my plan, I set up an Apache server with a MySQL database with
                        phpMyAdmin
                        on my computer. Unfortunately, it was only a hobby, and when I was offered the position of
                        technical
                        director in a new branch, I agreed and there was no more time to develop and support sites.
                        When in 2019 my family and I decided to start a new life and move to Prague I realized that I
                        want
                        to do what I really like. Since then I have started to learn modern web development. At the
                        moment my
                        tech stack is HTML, CSS, SASS entry level, JS , TS, React, Redux, REST API, some knowledge of
                        Material-UI,
                        AntDesign, Bootstrap. I continue to move on and at this stage I continue to practice JS, React,
                        Redux .</p>
